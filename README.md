# Python Bee

## Aim

Write a program out loud, one character at a time (yes… everything - even the whitespace) without looking at it.

## Setup

- The challenges are in this repository, grouped by difficulty level.
- Groups of ~3. One person playing, two people facilitating (i.e. typing in the player’s submission - more than one person to avoid typos!). Then swap over.
- Use a PLAIN TEXT EDITOR (e.g. notepad)
- Make sure everyone knows what Python version you’re using (2.7 & 3.6 tested).

## Gameplay

- Player selects difficulty level (easy/medium/hard) and question
- Question is read out - player can ask for clarification (facilitators answer any queries by referring to the question/doctests)
- Player spells out their solution
- Facilitators replace the text “# TODO: REPLACE ME WITH YOUR SOLUTION” with EXACTLY the characters the player said aloud.
- Doctests in the file are run - solution is deemed correct if they all pass. Only the first submission counts!
- 15 minutes max per question to keep things moving.

## Hints

- Wherever you stand on the tabs v.s spaces flame war, tabs are your friend for this…
- You’ll make life easier if you throw usual good naming out of the window - single character variable names are all the rage ;)
- You can say “backspace” if you make a mistake (but you can’t say “delete line”, or use a direction arrow/keyboard shortcut etc.)
- Be clear which of []{}() you mean.
- You can use your fingers as a stack to track the current indentation level.
- If you want an uppercase character, say so (lowercase assumed by default)
- Your solution doesn’t need to be the nicest way to do it, it just needs to work.

# CO-OP MODE

- Form a group (of ~6), and solve one of the challenges together - rotating round the group (and the keyboard!) to enter of the next character of the solution.
- You can now look at the code, but you are not allowed to communicate by ANY other means (or discuss your approach beforehand).
