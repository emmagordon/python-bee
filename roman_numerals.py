"""Write a function, f, which, given a positive integer, returns the
value as a roman numeral (in lowercase).

where, in roman numerals:
i = 1
v = 5
x = 10
l = 50
c = 100
d = 500

The value you return should use as few characters as possible, e.g. 4
should be 'iv' rather than 'iiii'.

You can assume the number you have to convert is < 1000.

>>> f(1)
'i'
>>> f(4)
'iv'
>>> f(36)
'xxxvi'
>>> f(140)
'cxl'
>>> f(827)
'dcccxxvii'
