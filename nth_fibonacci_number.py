"""The Fibonacci sequence is characterised by the fact that every number
after the first two is the sum of the two preceding terms. For such a
(zero-indexed) sequence beginning with the terms 0 and 1:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Write a function, f, which takes in an integer, n, (>=0) and returns
the nth Fibonacci number.

>>> f(0)
0
>>> f(1)
1
>>> f(2)
1
>>> f(3)
2
>>> f(4)
3
>>> f(11)
89
>>> f(17)
