"""A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive
divisors other than 1 and itself.

Write a function, f, which takes a positive integer as an argument and
returns True/False to indicate whether or not it's prime.

The longer your function takes to run, the less time you'll have to answer
other questions, so be efficient if you can!
